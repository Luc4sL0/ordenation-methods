# Ordenation Methods
It is often necessary to order the different values ​​stored within a vector in order to extract statistical information. Furthermore, it becomes less costly, from a computational processing perspective, to access certain elements of the vector when they are already ordered, as this way, it is possible to find the position of the elements with few mathematical operations.

Due to the importance of vector sorting, this code aims to study the performance of different sorting methods. The methods studied will be bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort. Both methods will be applied to three types of vectors, increasing, decreasing and random, aiming to identify the most effective ordering system for each type of vector.

In general, it is important to choose the sorting method that requires the least computational costs.
